We started [ReproducbiliTea Cambridge]({{ "/journal-clubs/#Cambridge ExPsy" | relative_url }}) in October 2018 and have had a wide range of attendees, from social and comparative psychologists to cognitive neuroscientists. Weâ€™ve even had a cardiovascular pharmacologist. One of my favourite parts of the journal club has been discussing reproducibility from so many perspectives.
  
Our sessions are usually run by graduates from the Department of Psychology but are open to anyone who is interested. We started with introductory topics and how to make our own research more reproducible, but have also branched out into more in-depth discussions on statistics and the philosophy of science.
      
The sessions have been lively, fun and informative, but it is the community which makes ReproducibiliTea so great, and who provide us with the motivation to make science great again.
