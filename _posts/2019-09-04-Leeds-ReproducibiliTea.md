Emily Williams and Kelly Lloyd have written [a blog post](https://leedsunilibrary.wordpress.com/2019/08/23/reproducibilitea-at-leeds/) covering the first two [ReproducibiliTea sessions at Leeds University]({{ "/journal-clubs/#Leeds" | relative_url }}). They welcomed attendees from a wide range of disciplines from Dentistry to Data Science, and covered Marcus Munaf√≤'s _Manifesto for Reproducible Science_ and Sebastian Karcher and Diana Kapiszewski's paper on _Openness in Practice in Qualitative Research_. To add an additional flourish, the latter meeting included a Skype call with the authors!
