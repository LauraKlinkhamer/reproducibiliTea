On the 24 March 2020 I organised the first online [ReproducibiliTea University of Bristol](https://reproducibiliTea.org/journal-clubs/#Bristol) meeting.  There were 12 of us in total, 6 from the University of Bristol and 6 from other institutions who saw the event advertised on my Twitter account and the [ReproducibiliTea Online calendar](https://reproducibiliTea.org/calendar). 

Amazingly, we started on time with no technical issues and after a short introduction we got stuck into the main topic of debate: “What can open science do for COVID-19?”. 

# Open COVID-19 research 

On the 24 March 2020 I organised the first online [ReproducibiliTea University of Bristol](https://reproducibiliTea.org/journal-clubs/#Bristol) meeting. Unusually, instead of a set reading we came together to debate the issue “What can open science do for COVID-19?”. I started by asking the group what open science could do, or is doing, for the pandemic. 

There was concern that more shared data, code and materials may mean more misinformation: Twitter is exploding with dodgy, over-simplified analyses using open COVID-19 data posted by people with no apparent research experience or credentials. More regression plots and visualisations of death counts, case counts and comparisons by country appear every day. 

Some of us questioned if openness is really the problem. Many people do bad science with less transparent research practices, and open research practices allow us to identify problems and call them out. If people misuse open research materials we will know, because they are open.  

The issue of misinformation may also stem from how people use, or abuse, open research. Why people access COVID-19 data and what problem they try to answer with it may determine if their answers harm or help others. For example, some people who post regression plots on Twitter maybe chasing likes, followers and clicks, rather than trying to inform effective public policy.  

Ultimately, there is a “a ton of garbage” but in amongst it is well-designed treasure, which is only possible on a large scale with shared data. Finding a way to sift through the rubbish and evaluate the helpful stuff could be very valuable. 

One person observed how we have seen simulation studies have major impacts on public policy during the pandemic, such as the [“COVID-19 reports”](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) from Imperial College London. This makes it even more important to share simulation code so others can replicate the methods and evaluate the model’s validity. For example, the code underlying a [particularly influential “COVID-19 report”](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf) is not currently available. The authors are now trying to share their code but [are finding it difficult](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf). 

Overall, we all agreed that sharing accessible and reuseable code, data and materials benefitted COVID-19 research but differed on who should be allowed to access these materials and how easily. 

# Student COVID-19 projects 

We then moved onto a new discussion: “Should we get students to analyse COVID-19 data as part of a student assignment?”. 

People thought this idea was exciting. Unlike many student projects, the research question would be incredibly relevant, so it offers students the chance to apply their skills to a real-world problem. This will probably make the project very engaging and interesting for students. The availability of open COVID-19 datasets also makes such a project quite feasible, although some datasets are missing metadata. 

On the other hand, the topic’s relevance may be a problem. It is an anxious time for many and giving students the opportunity to think about other things may benefit their wellbeing. Lecturers could offer an alternative assignment for students who do not want to work with COVID-19 data, but this may be tricky to manage. The potential impact from students’ work has positive and negative aspects. If students share their work, they could contribute to the public’s understanding of COVID-19 and this may spread more misinformation. However, learning to think about the impact your work may have and what it means to disseminate research is an important lesson in itself. Sharing their work more widely may also encourage students to double-check their work and reflect on its ethical aspects and the uncertainties of the (meta) data. Lecturers could also try to minimise the risk of students spreading misinformation by limiting how informative or controversial their interpretations could be, perhaps by controlling how much data students get. 

Overall, greater potential impact of a project increases both the potential benefits and risks. Lecturers would need to weigh up the risks of a COVID-19 project, such as students spreading misinformation or overloading anxious students, with the benefits, such as a highly relevant research question. 

# Preregistering COVID-19 research 

I then put a slightly different question to the group: did we think preregistration should be used for COVID-19 research, and if so how?”. 

This question slightly divided us. For some, preregistration is what you make it. You control how much time and detail you put into your preregistration, so it could be fast. Even though we may be doing alot of exploratory work in the context of this world-wide pandemic, it always makes sense to write down what you plan to do, regardless of how long it takes you. 

Two attendees working in computer and data science disagreed. Preregistration may be beneficial, but it is both hard to do and to discuss in computer science. One researcher wanted to pre-register their studies but found it difficult to do. The second researcher saw two different worlds within computer science: one building methods, the other applying methods. Preregistration felt particularly difficult for people who work on theoretical methods, who try many different things, throw away lots of stuff that doesn’t work, and don’t remember what they threw away. This researcher thought that preregistration is more suitable for applied computer scientists; for example, machine learning and language processing could gain something with pre-registration. 

# Registered Reports 

One attendee asked if they should submit a Registered Report now, given that the timescale for collecting data is so uncertain. In response, someone argued that COVID-19 shouldn’t hold you back from submitting a Registered Report because COVID-19 will likely affect everyone conducting similar studies and journals will hopefully understand the situation and be flexible. Now may also be a great time to think more about exploratory open research initiatives, for example the Exploratory Reports format currently offered by the International Review of Social Psychology and Cortex. 

# Final thoughts 

Overall we had a lively, relaxed discussion focusing on the roles that sharing research, Registered Reports, student projects and preregistration can play in COVID-19 research. I encourage others to hold relaxed, virtual discussions, and we’ve pooled our experience at ReproducibiliTea to offer some [guidelines on hosting](https://reproducibiliTea.org/online) these discussions. I’ve also written a short blog post [here](INSERT LINK) summarising the lessons I learnt from hosting a session on COVID-19 and using Bluejeans. 

# Lessons learnt and Bluejeans 

How-to guides on hosting virtual meetings are easy to find but there were a few specific lessons I learnt that others may find helpful. 

First, introductions. In the session I asked everyone to introduce themselves, their research and their motivation for attending. This took about 15 minutes but introductions could be more difficult and time-consuming with more people. Moderators can control the length of the introduction with the amount of information they ask each participant to give. The quickest approach is to ask everyone just to say their name. 

Secondly, I advise moderators check-in with attendees at the start. The COVID-19 pandemic is probably impacting them in some way, and it could be an emotionally challenging topic. Giving people the space to talk about how the crisis is affecting them and their work could be useful.  

In Bluejeans, only moderators can start, assign and end breakout rooms. You also have to join the call as a moderator – you cannot give moderator control over to another participant during the call. This creates a problem if you only have one moderator. If that moderator has any technical difficulties the meeting may be disrupted so it is worth assigning someone as the back-up moderator before the call starts. I tested the Breakout Rooms app before the call, but I also think it would be worth testing the function during the call too. I pushed everyone into the rooms but one person never made it to their room so they had to leave and rejoin the call. Running a test means you can be sure everyone will make it to their rooms and you can keep anyone with technical problems in the main room. 

Another issue is that breakout rooms cannot chat with each other. This can be awkward since the moderator has to end the rooms after the allocated time, which gives the rooms no opportunity to ask for more time and could be lead to quite an abrupt end. Also Bluejeans has dial-in functionality, but ends the meeting at the scheduled end-time for anyone who dials-in. I recommend making the meeting longer than necessary to allow for the meeting to run over without expelling dial-in attendees. 

The frequency and duration of breakout sessions are also worth planning. Many short sessions may mean participants feel pushed in and out of conversations. This may be good for a rapid-fire conversation (e.g. speed-dating style debates) but not if you want participants to get into the nitty-gritty of a topic. 

My last piece advice to others who may want to run a ReproducibiliTea Online session is to dedicate the first 5 minutes to allowing everyone to get into the room, test their connection and iron out any technical difficulties.
