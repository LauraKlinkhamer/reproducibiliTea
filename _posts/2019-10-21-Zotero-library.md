Many Journal Club organisers have asked for suggestions of papers, or mentioned that it would be good to see what other JCs have been discussing. We thought the best way to address these points would be to set up a [Zotero group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2354006/reproducibilitea/items/) for ReproducibiliTea. The library has the following features:

* All papers added to any subcollection get added to the overall library 
    - => Easy to find new papers
* Each JC can have its own subcollection, and as many sub-subcollections as they wish (we're organising on a term-by-term basis at [Oxford](/journal-clubs/#Oxford))
    - => Easy to see what other JCs are doing
* Incredibly simple integration if you already use Zotero for managing references, bibTex exports are available if you don't

We think this is a pretty good solution for minimising duplication, keeping things neatly organised, and for potential future extensions (we can write scripts to interface neatly with the Zotero library). As a reference manager, Zotero is free for basic use, and has good integration with reproducibile science tools such as RStudio (through the `citr` package).

**Anyone can browse the group library** and subscribe to updates, but only authorised members can **edit** collections, including adding items or creating new subcollections. All JC organisers are invited to join as authorised members.

## Getting authorised

1. Create/log into your [Zotero account](https://www.zotero.org/)
2. Go to [the library homepage](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2354006/reproducibilitea?) and request membership
3. Wait until I'm next at my email to approve your request!

## Using the library

Once you're approved, the first thing you should do is create a new subcollection for your JC. You can then create further subcollections within that to keep things neatly organised if you wish. 

You can browse all the items in the whole library by viewing the Library collection, and select any items you want to add to your subcollections. You can also add new items directly to one of your subcollections and it'll automatically be listed in the main Library. 

## Using Zotero

If you want to use Zotero as your own reference manager, in addition to using it to organise your JC papers, you can use the same account you just created and put items in your personal library. If you download the desktop client you'll see the ReproducibiliTea Library listed as a group library below your personal one. It syncs automatically so you'll always be up to date.
