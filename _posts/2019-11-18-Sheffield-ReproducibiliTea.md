Sheffield University held their first ReproducibiliTea meeting in October 2019.  We had about 15 people come along from medicine, biology, engineering and psychology, with [Stavrina Dimosthenous](https://twitter.com/stavrhina), a PhD researcher in materials science, leading the discussion.  Stavrina asked us: [Is the Replicability Crisis Overblown? Three Arguments Examined](https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691612463401), a psychology paper by Pashler and Harris, 2012.  We discussed what [p-values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value) are, and how [p-hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) can arise when researchers discard “outlier” data that doesn’t support their hypothesis.

Hypothesis testing led us to think about what happens when a researcher finds a [negative result](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_result), when the data fails to confirm the hypothesis.  In our meeting, some people had seen negative outcomes of clinical trials published in “[high impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor)” journals, because these negative outcomes risked harming patients, but not when results show no clear outcome either way.  Some attendees felt that experimental design and publication quality was generally high in their area of research.  But in other research areas, some attendees thought quality was more variable, and questioned whether journals and [peer reviewers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) had sufficient incentive (or time) to ensure published research is high quality.

The next [Sheffield ReproducibiliTea](/journal-clubs/#Sheffield) is on November 14, see you there!
