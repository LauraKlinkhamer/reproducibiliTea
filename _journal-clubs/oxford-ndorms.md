Want to improve the rigour and transparency of your research? Interested in discussing the principles of research reproducibility and recent advances in the open science community? The ReproducibiliTea NDORMS journal club will cover all aspects of research integrity and reproducible science.

Anyone is welcome, from students to professors, basic scientists to clinicians, and open science sceptics to reproducibility enthusiasts. We promote a friendly and inclusive environment, ensuring that everyone has a chance to contribute, so we can all learn from each other’s experiences to improve the way we think, do and share research.

We meet every Wednesday of the academic term from 1-2 pm, at the Botnar Research Centre (Old Road, OX3 7LD). Light refreshments, some nibbles and, of course, tea will be provided (but you’re free to bring your own goods)!
