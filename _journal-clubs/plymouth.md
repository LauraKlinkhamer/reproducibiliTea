Our ReproducibiliTea Journal Club welcomes both staff and students. Our aim is to
create a safe space, where we can discuss how should we do Open Science, how
should we think about Transparent Science, and a bit of philosophy of Open Science.
For each session, we select a target paper to read and discuss. We maintain a
webpage where we have links to papers, dates and places, journal club entries, and follow-up
materials: [Plymouth ReproducibiliTea](https://lenarddome.github.io/reproducibilitea/)
