This ReproducibiliTea is associated with the Mannheim Open Science Meetup, bringing together open science enthusiasts across various institutions in Mannheim.

As our community consists of various disciplines, the ReproducibiliTea Mannheim wants to cover open science topics of broader interest. Meetings will be held monthly. Being "born" during the pandemic, we don't have a real life meeting location (yet!).
