Join us on **Thursdays at 17:30 - 18:30 in KS7**. Please note that the journal club runs during term time only.

This journal club is open to all University of Kent students and staff, from all departments and disciplines. We hope to make the journal club multidisciplinary and inclusive of all attitudes towards open science - diversity of opinions makes for the best discussions! There will be a short presentation of the paper, followed by an open discussion among attendees.

We look forward to seeing you there!
