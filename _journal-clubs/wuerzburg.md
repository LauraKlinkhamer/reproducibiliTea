**About:** The journal club is open to everyone! 

We started the Wuerzburg open science journal club in 2018. We're now a small group of bachelors' students, PhD researchers and postdocs, and we hope to welcome people from other departments and disciplines as well. We usually meet every second or third Wednesday at 6pm at Room 217 in the Marcusstr. The dates as well as topics/papers discussed will be announced via our mailing list, which you can join by signing up [here](https://lists.uni-wuerzburg.de/mailman/listinfo/open-science).
