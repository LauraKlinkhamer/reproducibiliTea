**About**

ReproducibiliTea Rotterdam is a journal club organized by the Open Science Community Rotterdam ([OSCR](http://www.openscience-rotterdam.com/home/)). We discuss documents addressing various topics on open science practices.

**Format**

- Every session, one discussant chooses a published article, preprint, or blog post about a specific open science topic (e.g., the advantages of publishing your work in open access journals, criticism of pre-publication peer review, best practices of data/code curation/sharing, ...). The discussant prepares a short presentation (5'-15') summarizing the main points of the document, but the bulk of the meeting (45'-55') is dedicated to open discussion: is the topic relevant for your field of research? In case of specific issues, has anybody proposed and/or implemented some solutions? Can any of these solutions be translated, scaled, and applied in other research areas?

- Even though some papers, at first glance, seem to relate only to a specific discipline (e.g., psychology has been working on open science issues quite intensively in the past years), we aim to extract general lessons that can be helpful for researchers in different fields.

- A different discussant will take care of the initial summary, ensuring that different research areas are represented.

**Attendees**

This journal club is open to everyone: PhD students, post-docs, junior and senior faculty, from any school/department at EUR and ErasmusMC. Interested Bachelor and Master students are also welcome to join, especially if it can be helpful for their thesis.

**Practical Information**

From November 2019 we will meet on the second Wednesday of every month at 11:00. An invitation will be sent at least 2 weeks prior to the scheduled meeting. If you are interested in joining but have not received an invitation, please contact Antonio Schettino (schettino@eur.nl). The Erasmus Research Services ([ERS](https://www.eur.nl/onderzoek/research-services/erasmus-research-services)) will provide refreshments!
