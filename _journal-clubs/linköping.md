**About:**
The journal club is open to everyone across Linköping University, from any discipline or department (all campuses included). Everyone is welcome to join us - skeptics and enthusiasts alike! For each session, the presenter will provide a short (5-15mins) overview of the chosen paper with the remainder of the session dedicated to free discussion amongst all attendees.
