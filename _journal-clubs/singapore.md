Singapore ReproducibiliTea is a joint intitative of researchers from the National Institute of Education (NIE) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and kindly supported by both NIE and NTU libraries. We welcome researchers at any career stage and from any reserach fields to read target papers we select each week and join us for some ReprroducibiliTehPeng, snacks and open science chats. In most sessions we also set up a videoconference link for researchers based at NTU's second campus in Novena or interested researchers from other institutions to join us. Information on the dates, location and topics to discuss in each meeting can be found on our [OSF page](https://osf.io/y7c5p/), our Twitter accounf @SingReproTea or by contacting alexa.vonhagen@nie.edu.sg. You can also read more about our past encounters on the [NTU library blog](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/ntulibrary/2019/11/07/reproducibilitea1/).
